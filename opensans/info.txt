python history

python is a widely used general purpose, high level programming language
it is initially designed by guido van rossum in 1991 and later developed by python software foundation
python is so popular because of its readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.

The python language originated from the ABC language. Guido Van Rossum had taken the syntax of ABC
                    language and some of the good features of the ABC language like Exception handling.
                    Guido Van Rossum was a big fan of a TV show called Monty Pythonâ€™s Flying Circus, so he named his
                    invention 'Python'.
